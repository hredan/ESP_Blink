# ESP Hello World
ESP_HELLO_WORLD is an example to build ESP firmware binaries on a GitHub Runner with the help of [eep-build-action](https://github.com/hredan/eep-build-action), to create a package for different OS types with the help of [load-eef-action](https://github.com/hredan/load-eef-action) and [ESPEASYFLASHER_2.0](https://github.com/hredan/ESPEASYFLASHER_2.0). This example is intended to show how easy it is to build and share esp firmware binaries with [ESPEASYFLASHER_2.0](https://github.com/hredan/ESPEASYFLASHER_2.0).

The ESP_HELLO_WORLD example it self, is sending a "Hello World" as Morse Code by the Build-in LED and sends messages over the serial interface that can be received with the [ESPEASYFLASHER_2.0](https://github.com/hredan/ESPEASYFLASHER_2.0) for analyzing.
